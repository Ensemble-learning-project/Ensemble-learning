# Predicting Airbnb Prices in New York City
This project analyzes the New York City Airbnb dataset to gain insights into market trends and predict listing prices using various Ensemble learning models. The analysis covers the following steps:

Data preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis, including outlier handling and categorical data visualization
Neighborhood analysis
Price distribution and room type distribution
Supply and demand analysis
The best-performing model for predicting Airbnb listing prices was the LightGBM model with KFold and GridSearch.

# Implementing a Decision Tree from Scratch in Python
This project implements a decision tree from scratch in Python, allowing for both regression and classification tasks. The decision tree algorithm includes the following steps:

Handling missing values
Avoiding overfitting through dimensionality reduction
Balancing the dataset to prevent bias
Implementing impurity metrics for both regression (MSE, MAE) and classification tasks (Gini, Entropy)
The code is organized into classes for the decision tree, decision tree classifier, and decision tree regressor, each with their respective functions. Model performance was tested on the breast cancer dataset for classification and a toy dataset for regression.
